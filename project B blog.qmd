## Introduction

Welcome to my blog, where we explore various subject regarding science and data analysis.

This first post is dedicated to a project where I analyzed data from Nhanes to explore the effects of gender, race, and weight on BMI. Various analyses were used for this project such as T-test, ANOVA, contingency tables, and regressions. Through these tests, we were able to determine that gender, race, and weight all have significant effects on BMI.
